### React Native Coding Challenge 

## Setup

Before joining the call, please ensure that the local app is set up properly and running on an iOS simulator (if you have a Mac available) or an Android simulator (Windows).

# IOS / Mac
Make sure you're using XCode (12+).
- `yarn` 
- `cd ios && pod install --repo-update`
- `yarn start` in current terminal
- open a new terminal (or tab) and run `yarn ios` (if the initial run happens to fail, try it a second time)

# Android / Windows
Using Android Studio 4.0.1, others will probably work too

If you've never used Android Studio follow the instructions here to set up for React-Native development https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Create an Emulator with the AVD Manager
- `yarn`
- `yarn start` in current terminal
- open a new terminal (or tab) and run `yarn android`


## Challenge
We will give you the challenge at the time of the interview. To prepare, please familiarize yourself with ReduxJS Toolkit, TypeScript, and React Hooks.
